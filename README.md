# Django Exercise

This resolution has been done in almost 3 hours. Please keep in mind below comments!

## Background

My last experience as a Python (Django) Developer as 4 years ago. I felt that in spite of having used DRF only once I was able to understood basic framework flow. In order to save time I decided to use a Django template based on repl.it insted of setting up a new environment in my local drive.

## Setup

I think I was able to solve it by adding 2 dependencies and creating docker files. My last time using Docker (for a GraphQL test I need to perform) was 2 years ago.

## Excercises

Tried to solve Exercise 1 and 2. Did not have time to solve Excercise 3.

## Troubleshooting

As described in Background section, for some reason I do not know (could be related with not using Django in a long time ago) I was to able to run on repl.it environment basic Django's commands such as:

```
shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Or was not able to get rid of starter Django message: "The install worked successfully! Congratulations! You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs."

## Greetings

Thanks for this opportunity!
